# Assignment_1_Stereo_vision
First assignment of 3DSSF

Design and implementation of these stereo-matching schemes:
> Naive stereo matching.
          with Normal and Parallel execution
> Dynamic programming approach.
          with Normal and Parallel execution 
          
> Comparison of solution to an existing implementation

> Displaying the output disparity images (e.g. using OpenCV).
    
> Given the input camera parameters conversion of the disparities to 3D point cloud.

    saved it in a file .xyz format as suggested and can be found in outputs folder of each data,
    
Input data

I have used Middlebury stereo datasets with standard focal length 3740 and 160mm baseline.

I have uploaded only one output folder of Aloe pair with name OP-Aloe, due to size limitation on Github I cannot upload more than 25MB but I will discuss everything in tohe documentation
